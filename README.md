This is a fork project of [Dolibarr/dolibarr](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr).

Its intent is to be able to create custom modifications on the core code of [Dolibarr](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr), in a correct way.

The version branches are regularly rebased on the new releases of Dolibarr/dolibarr. On this rebase, the specific commits of this repo are reapplied.

As such, all the commits done here will always be (re-)applied AFTER every update of the core code of Dolibarr. Modifications will be kept accross the evolution of Dolibarr.

Feel free to suggest modifications if you find yourself in need of such behavior.

For now, my needs are : 
- simplification of the extrafields that are not working.
- other that will be updated here
